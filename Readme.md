## Tips

- use hooks
- use effects instead of using the "normal" react lifecycle (componenWill..)
- look into https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-react 
- look into https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-state-tree
- state management in a graphql area (to view)
- to look into libraries easy peasy, overmind
- redux toolkit (mutable under the hood) vs mobx
